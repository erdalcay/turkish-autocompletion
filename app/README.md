# Auto-completion App UI
Simple front-end for Turkish Auto-completion that uses Express & React to serve the app.

To build & run locally, simply do:
```
npm run build-start
```

## Configuration

In order for Express server to function properly, there needs to be an auto-completion API service up & running.

Use `.env` to pass in the API endpoint. See the [example file.](.env.example)

The auto-completion service can be found & deployed [here.](../suggestions)
